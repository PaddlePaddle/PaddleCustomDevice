# TODO(duanyanhui):
# Devices differ in accurary, so we need to build different white_list for
# diffrent device. For example, ascend dose not aupport vell well for int64_t 
# and double. The cast of data type will bring errors. We need to put that 
# kernel in the op_threshlod_white_list.

# Next, we will built white_list for each device and put it on backends.
